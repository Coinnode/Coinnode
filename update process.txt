Please update the wallet immediately, if you do not use new wallet, then the upcoming masternode-rewards or staking-rewards will not be valid. This process is simple: 
1. Close wallet
2. Visit this folder at C:/users/***Your windows username***/appdata(hidden)/roaming/Coinnode 
3. Copy wallet.dat file as this file has all your coins in it. Paste this file on desktop or some folder
4. Delete entire Coinnode folder
5. Delete the Coinnode-qt (wallet)
6. Download the new wallet from http://Coinnode.com
7. Run the new wallet, then let it sync. Once sync is complete, you should close the wallet.
8. Now Coinnode folder will be created automatically in the computer. You should visit the folder """""C:/users/***Your windows username***/appdata(hidden)/roaming/Coinnode 
and then replace the wallet.dat file with your backed up wallet.dat file that has your coins in it.
9. Open / Run the wallet and start to make new masternode if you have enough coins.
